README

This folder contains my final project for CS646 in Fall 2014. Enclosed is an app utilizing a master-detail GUI to allow users to create, update, and tag notes with relevant criteria they deem suitable. 

Also featured is a web view tool, to allow users to reference content online, should their own resources prove insufficient.

The app was designed for the iPad. It does not look like nor behave quite as intended on the iPhone.
